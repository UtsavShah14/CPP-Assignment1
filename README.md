# CPP-Assignment1
The Programs are written in Java for CPP assignment 1 (GCD).
Readme File has the questions that I have attempted to solve. If u have any suggestions for the changes in the code, plz let me know.

Q1) Write a thread that tosses a coin 1000 times and computes the frequency of heads and tails. A coin can be modelled by a random number generator that generates random numbers in the range 0..1.

Q2) Write a thread that continuously prints a message every 100 milliseconds while it is still alive. The thread should be written in such a way that it can be terminated at any time by a control program (main).

Q3) Write a program that employs 2 threads that each toss their own die (modelled by a random number generator that generates random numbers in the range 1..6) a given number of times. In both cases the result of each toss is stored in a shared array. The array is deemed to be large enough to store the result of every throw and each thread should only write to its own array segment. Once the threads have completed their work then the main program counts the frequency of each number thrown and prints it on the screen.
